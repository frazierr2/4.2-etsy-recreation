# 4.2 Etsy Recreation

This project we used Etsy's API and practiced with JSONP and JSON data. We then created a recreation of one projects page with AJAX calls.


### Tech Used

During the development of this project I used the following technology:


* [HTML5] - latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages
* [CSS3] - latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [jQuery] - fast and concise Javascript Library
